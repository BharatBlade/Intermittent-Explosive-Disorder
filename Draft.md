A Systematic Review of Etiology and Pathophysiology of Intermittent Explosive Disorder

  

Abstract

Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of failure to resist aggressive impulses that may result in serious physical assault to other persons and/or episodes involving the destruction of property of non-trivial value (DSM-V-TR). IED is complex with a range of etiologic and pathophysiologic factors. While the exact mechanisms underlying IED are not fully understood, research has suggested that it is associated with a range of biological and psychosocial factors. These include genetic predisposition, neurobiological abnormalities, environmental stressors, and comorbid mental health conditions . [[fisher2017 - Use of structural family therapy with an individual client diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder A case study.pdf#page=17&selection=5,33,7,73|fisher2017]] [[modestino2022 - Theorizing the Role of Dopaminergic Polymorphic Risk Alleles with Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED).pdf#page=3&selection=22,18,30,82|modestino2022]]

Introduction

Background

Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is a mental health condition characterized by impulsive aggression that can begin in as early as childhood and follows a chronic course [[puhalla2020 - History of childhood abuse and alcohol use disorder Relationship with intermittent explosive disorder and intoxicated aggression frequency.pdf#page=4&selection=244,0,266,66|puhalla2020]] [[pereira2021 - Prevalence and psychiatric comorbidities of intermittent explosive disorders in Metropolitan São Paulo, Brazil.pdf#page=1&selection=86,39,89,60|pereira2021]] [[george2022 - Depression, anxiety, and intermittent explosive disorder among Black Caribbean and African American adolescents.pdf#page=19&selection=42,10,57,87|george2022]]. These impulses to react can be triggered by minor events or perceived slights. The aggressive behavior is disproportionate to these perceived slights, and can't be better explained by other medical, including psychiatric, conditions, or an alternate organic cause. [[mccloskey2018 - Understanding the development and management of antisocial disorders in adolescents.pdf#page=8&selection=65,36,73,47|mccloskey2018]] This can lead to consequences such as assaulting someone or causing damage to property. The person with IED often feels deep remorse for their actions afterward.

Epidemiology

Psychiatric Comorbidities

  

Neuroanatomy

Understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of IED is important for several reasons, including providing insights into the theoretical and clinical implications of this disorder, and helping in discovering effective treatments. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that IED is related to possible brain impairments. Structural brain imaging has also been used extensively to examine the morphology of brain tissues in individuals with mental disorders. Overall, understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of IED is crucial for developing effective treatments and improving our understanding of the disorder.

Amygdala

The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped region located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain that plays a crucial role in the processing of emotions, particularly fear and anger. In the context of IED, the amygdala has been proposed to have a significant role due to its involvement in regulating impulsive behaviors and emotional responses.

 The amygdala is part of the limbic system, which is responsible for the processing of emotions and the regulation of behavior. It receives input from the thalamus, which is responsible for relaying sensory information to the brain, and sends output to the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision-making and the regulation of behavior. The amygdala also has direct connections with the hypothalamus, which is responsible for regulating hormones and the autonomic nervous system. Studies have shown that the amygdala is involved in the processing of social threats and the regulation of aggression. Recent research utilizing new diagnostic criteria for IED has allowed for empirical investigations into the role of the amygdala in this condition.

For example, research has shown that individuals with IED have increased amygdala reactivity to social threats, which may contribute to their impulsive and aggressive behavior (Coccaro et al., 2007). Additionally, studies have shown that the amygdala is involved in the regulation of the serotonergic system, which is has been the primary neurotransmitter of interest for its potential involvement in IED (Coccaro, 1989). For example, individuals with IED show a stronger amygdala response to angry faces than healthy controls, and amygdala activation to angry faces is correlated with a lifetime history of aggression and the number of prior aggressive acts (Seok, 2020). This suggests that the amygdala may be over-responsive to cues that trigger aggressive impulses, contributing to the impulsivity and aggression characteristic of IED. 

Reduced functional connectivity in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex was seen in patients with IED, which was correlated with aberrant regulation of the prefrontal cortex (Seok, 2020). Moreover, studies have found that the level of amygdala activation in response to these stimuli is associated with the severity of IED symptoms, which supports the notion that the amygdala's role in IED pathology extends beyond its basic function in emotion processing to a more dynamic interplay with other brain regions. In summary, the relevance of the amygdala in IED lies in its central role in processing emotions that can trigger aggression, as well as its potential dysregulated interactions with other brain regions involved in the regulation of impulses and behavior. However, the relationship between amygdala volumes and IED remains unclear due to inconsistent findings in the literature. Some studies have reported reduced amygdala volumes in individuals with IED, while others have found no significant differences when compared to healthy controls. These conflicting results may be attributed to methodological variations such as sample size, demographic characteristics of the participants, and the specific measures used to assess amygdala volume. Understanding the amygdala's role in IED could contribute to developing targeted interventions for this disorder, such as therapies aimed at enhancing the PFC's ability to regulate amygdala activity or medications that modulate serotonergic pathways connected to the amygdala.

Frontal Cortex

The frontal cortex plays a crucial role in human aggression. It is a region of the brain that is involved in the regulation of emotions, decision-making, and behavior. Studies have shown that individuals with Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) have abnormalities in the frontal cortex that may contribute to their aggressive behavior. Abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex can lead to difficulties in inhibiting responses to provocation or stress, contributing to the aggressive outbursts characteristic of IED.

One study found that individuals with IED had reduced gray matter density in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is a region of the frontal cortex that is involved in the regulation of emotions and behavior. Another study found that individuals with IED had reduced activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is a region of the frontal cortex that is involved in decision-making and impulse control. The ventral prefrontal cortex (VPC) is a region that is involved in the processing of emotions and the regulation of social behavior. Studies have shown that the VPC is activated during aggressive behavior, suggesting that it plays a role in the initiation and control of aggressive acts. Research has found that individuals with IED may have reduced volume in specific regions of the prefrontal cortex, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC), which are involved in top-down control over impulses and emotional regulation. Additionally, functional imaging studies have shown altered activity in these regions during tasks that require impulse control or exposure to aggression cues, suggesting a dysregulated response in individuals with IED. Peng et al. (2012) conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using a color-word Stroop task and found higher error-related activity in individuals with IED compared to controls, suggesting less optimized brain response in the PFC during conflict monitoring (Peng et al., 2012). This finding aligns with other research that links reduced serotonin function with impulsivity and aggressive behaviors.

These findings suggest that the frontal cortex may play a role in the development and maintenance of IED. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of the frontal cortex in human aggression and to develop effective treatments for IED.

Hypothalamus

The relevance of the hypothalamus in IED can be explored by examining its role in regulating aggression and other behaviors associated with the disorder. The hypothalamus is a small, almond-shaped structure located at the base of the brain that plays a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions including hunger, thirst, sleep, and temperature regulation. It is also deeply involved in the control of emotions and behaviors, particularly those related to stress and aggression. The hypothalamus has been implicated in the modulation of this behavior due to its connections with other parts of the brain involved in emotion regulation, such as the prefrontal cortex (which is responsible for executive functions and decision-making), and the amygdala (which processes fear and emotional responses).

Research suggests that people with IED may have altered activity in these networks, leading to a dysregulation of emotional control mechanisms. For example, studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown increased activation in the hypothalamus during tasks that induce aggression or negative emotions in individuals with IED compared to healthy controls. This suggests that the hypothalamus may be more responsive to stressors and less capable of modulating the subsequent emotional responses in these individuals.

Additionally, neurotransmitter imbalances have been linked to IED, with serotonin deficiency being a common finding. The hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of serotonergic pathways, and decreased activity in this region could contribute to reduced serotonin levels, which are associated with increased aggression and impulsivity. Some studies have indicated that patients with IED exhibit cerebral hypometabolism, which could be secondary to impaired regulation by the hypothalamus (13). The hypothalamus's role in the endocrine system and its relationship with serotonin function, which is known to be impaired in IED, further underscores its importance in understanding the disorder (16).

Further research into the specific connections between the hypothalamus and other brain regions involved in IED would help to clarify its role in the disorder. Understanding these mechanisms could lead to targeted treatments for individuals with IED, such as medications that modulate serotonergic activity or interventions aimed at strengthening cognitive control pathways.

  

Neurobiology

Serotonin

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, behavior, and cognition. Serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan and is primarily found in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem, with projections to various regions including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala via the dorsal and median raphe pathways. It acts on a variety of 5-HT receptors, which are classified into seven main families based on their sequence similarities (5-HT1 to 5-HT7). Notably these include, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, and 5-HT7. These receptors are involved in modulating mood, sleep, appetite, and aggression. For instance, the 5-HT1A receptor plays a role in anxiety and fear response, while the 5-HT2A receptor is associated with aggression (14). The 5-HT3 receptor modulates nausea and vomiting, and the 5-HT4 receptor is involved in cognitive functions such as learning and memory. The 5-HT7 receptor is linked to mood regulation and cognition (15). In the context of IED, alterations in serotonin function appear to play a role in the pathophysiology of the disorder.

Serotonin receptors and transporters are involved in the regulation of various physiological functions, including mood, behavior, and cognition. Serotonin transporters, which are responsible for reuptake of serotonin from the synapse, have also been studied in IED, as medications targeting these transporters, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have shown some efficacy in reducing aggression in patients with IED (16). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been prescribed for individuals with IED, although their efficacy is not fully established. In some cases, these medications can reduce the frequency and severity of impulsive aggression-related behaviors, suggesting a link between serotonergic activity and IED pathophysiology.

 Reduced levels of serotonin or dysfunction of its receptors and transporters can lead to impaired emotional regulation and increased aggression, which are hallmark symptoms of IED. In the context of IED, aberrant serotonin transporter and serotonin 2a receptor binding have been reported. Specifically, reduced serotonin transporter availability in the anterior cingulate has been observed in IED subjects compared with controls. Increased activation of the serotonin 2a receptor in the orbitofrontal cortex has been observed in IED subjects with active physical aggression. For example, some research suggests that the 5-HT2A receptor may be upregulated in individuals with IED, potentially contributing to an increase in aggressive behavior. Additionally, dysregulation of the 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors has been associated with impulsivity, a key feature of IED. Reduced numbers of platelet serotonin transporters have been reported in IED subjects, as well as reduced responsiveness of 5-HT receptors to stimulation. Additionally, reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid metabolites of 5-HT have been observed in IED subjects.

Norepinephrine

Norepinephrine (NE) is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the regulation of various physiological processes, including attention, arousal, and mood. NE is synthesized in the locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem and released in response to various stimuli, including stress, fear, and pain. NE acts on alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors, which are located in various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. Alpha-1 receptors are primarily involved in the regulation of arousal and attention, while alpha-2 receptors are involved in the regulation of mood and anxiety. NE also interacts with other neurotransmitters, including serotonin and dopamine, to modulate various physiological processes. For example, NE and serotonin have a reciprocal inhibitory relationship, meaning that an increase in one neurotransmitter leads to a decrease in the other. NE is also involved in the regulation of impulsive aggression through its interaction with the dopaminergic system. NE has been shown to increase the release of dopamine in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brainstem, which is involved in the regulation of reward and motivation. These interactions are thought to play a role in the regulation of impulsive aggression in IED. In the context of Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), NE has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder due to its involvement in the regulation of impulsive aggression. In addition to its role in the regulation of impulsive aggression, NE has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of IED through its involvement in the regulation of stress and anxiety. NE has been shown to play a role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is involved in the regulation of the stress response.

The role of norepinephrine in the pathophysiology of IED has been explored in several studies. A study by Peng et al. (2016) investigated the relationship between plasma norepinephrine levels and aggression using a validated laboratory measure of impulsive aggression, the provocation paradigm, in individuals with IED and healthy controls. They found that individuals with IED had significantly higher baseline plasma norepinephrine levels compared to controls, suggesting a potential role for norepinephrine in the etiology of IED (Peng et al., 2016). Another study by Fitzgerald et al. (2014) examined the relationship between monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) genotype and aggression in individuals with IED, as MAO-A is involved in the metabolism of norepinephrine. They found that individuals with the low activity MAO-A variant had increased aggression and impulsivity, further implicating norepinephrine in the pathophysiology of IED (Fitzgerald et al., 2014). In addition, a placebo-controlled trial by Coccaro et al. (2006) investigated the efficacy of the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine in the treatment of IED and reported that atomoxetine was effective in reducing aggression and impulsivity in individuals with IED, providing evidence for a potential therapeutic role of targeting norepinephrine in the treatment of this disorder (Coccaro et al., 2006). Taken together, these studies suggest that norepinephrine plays a significant role in the etiology and pathophysiology of IED, and may be a promising target for pharmacological interventions.

Dopamine

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in reward, motivation, and movement. It is synthesized in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain and is involved in the mesolimbic dopamine (reward) pathway, which includes the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), ventral striatum (VS), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). They also project to the basal ganglia via the nigrostriatal pathway, which is important for motor control and habit formation. Dopamine is released in response to rewarding stimuli, such as food, sex, and drugs, and is involved in the experience of pleasure and reward. Dopaminergic dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of IED. Studies have shown that individuals with IED have reduced dopaminergic activity in the NAcc and VS, which may contribute to their impulsive and aggressive behavior.

Dopamine receptors are proteins that bind to dopamine and mediate its effects on neurons. There are five subtypes of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5. Dopamine receptors are divided into two main classes - D1-like (D1 and D5) and D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) receptors.  D1 and D5 receptors are primarily located in the NAcc and VS, respectively, and are involved in reward processing. D1 receptors increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, while D2 receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase and decrease cAMP levels. The DRD2 gene encodes the D2 dopamine receptor, which plays a critical role in reward, motivation, and emotion regulation.  D2 receptors are located in the VS, NAcc, and PFC and are involved in both reward processing and movement. D3 receptors are primarily located in the PFC and are involved in the regulation of mood and cognition. D4 receptors are located in the PFC, hippocampus, and cortex and are involved in the regulation of stress and reward.

Dopamine transporters are proteins that transport dopamine from the synapse back into the neuron, where it can be reused. There are two subtypes of dopamine transporters: DAT1 and DAT2. DAT1 is primarily located in the NAcc and VS and is involved in the regulation of reward processing. DAT2 is primarily located in the PFC and is involved in the regulation of movement and cognition.

For instance, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the promoter regions of the D2 receptor gene (DRD2) have been linked to aggression and impulsivity. Polymorphisms in the dopaminergic system, such as the DRD2 Taq A1 (rs1800497) and DAT1 (40 BP repeat VNTR) polymorphisms, have also been associated with IED. The DAT1 gene (SLC6A3) has been implicated in IED, with some studies reporting that certain variants may be associated with impulsive aggression and increased risk for IED. For example, one study found that individuals with IED showed decreased brain activity in response to monetary rewards, indicating a potential deficit in the dopaminergic reward pathway. Another study found that IED was associated with a greater response to methylphenidate, a drug that increases dopamine levels, suggesting that these individuals may have a reduced baseline dopamine level.

Glutamate

Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the brain's communication system. It is involved in various physiological processes, including learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity. Glutamate is involved in the formation of new synapses and the strengthening of existing ones, which is essential for long-term memory and learning. Glutamate is synthesized from glutamic acid and is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain.  There are several subtypes of glutamate receptors, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate, and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. These receptors are located on the surface of neurons and are responsible for the excitatory effects of glutamate. 

In IED, alterations in glutamate signaling have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder. Studies have shown that individuals with IED have reduced levels of glutamate in the brain, as well as alterations in the expression of glutamate receptors and transporters. For example, a study by Kraguljac et al. (2012) found that higher levels of glutamate in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were associated with a good response to risperidone in unmedicated patients with IED. This suggests that glutamate may play a role in the treatment response of IED. Additionally, altered glutamate metabolism has been reported in individuals with IED, as evidenced by decreased glutamine synthetase activity and increased glutamate levels in the cerebellum (15). Furthermore, imaging studies have shown abnormalities in glutamatergic neurotransmission in brain regions implicated in emotional regulation, such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, in individuals with IED (16). These findings suggest that glutamate dysregulation might play a role in the impulsive aggression observed in IED.

 Research has indicated that people with IED may have altered levels of NMDA receptor subunits. Specifically, genetic polymorphisms in the GRIN2B gene, which encodes for the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, have been associated with IED (17). Changes in the expression of these receptors can affect synaptic plasticity and learning, which are thought to be involved in the development of impulsive aggression. Alterations in AMPA receptor composition or density have also been associated with IED. This may influence neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, potentially contributing to the impulsivity and aggression seen in the disorder.

GABA

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the regulation of neural activity in the brain. It is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain and is involved in various physiological processes, including learning, memory, and mood regulation. GABA receptors are located on the surface of neurons and are responsible for the binding of GABA molecules. There are two main types of GABA receptors: GABA-A receptors and GABA-B receptors (GAT1 and GAT3). GABA-A transporters are responsible for the uptake of GABA from the synapse, while GABA-B transporters are involved in the removal of excess GABA from the brain. GABA-A receptors are responsible for the inhibitory effects of GABA on neural activity, while GABA-B receptors are involved in the regulation of pain perception and the modulation of other neurotransmitter systems. GABA transporters are responsible for the uptake of GABA molecules from the synapse and the removal of excess GABA from the brain.

Several studies have found that patients with IED exhibit reduced GABA levels or impaired GABA function in various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. This could lead to decreased inhibition of aggressive responses and increased impulsivity (Lee & Coccaro, 2019). For example, one study found that patients with IED had lower levels of GABA in their cerebrospinal fluid compared to healthy controls. This suggests that there may be alterations in GABAergic neurotransmission in individuals with IED, potentially contributing to the overactive brain circuits associated with impulsive aggression. For instance, one study using positron emission tomography (PET) found decreased binding of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor ligand used to assess GABAergic function, in the prefrontal cortex and limbic regions of individuals with IED compared to controls. Additionally, polymorphisms in genes encoding for GABA receptors or transporters have been associated with increased aggression and impulsivity, further supporting a role for GABA in the etiology of IED.

GABAA receptors are the primary target for benzodiazepines, which are used as treatment for IED. Additionally, there have been reports of treatments that modulate GABAergic function (such as benzodiazepines) being effective for managing impulsive aggression in some cases. The anticonvulsant valproate, known to enhance GABAergic activity, has also shown efficacy in managing aggression in various patient populations, including those with IED. These findings suggest that GABA dysregulation may contribute to the pathophysiology of IED and that targeting the GABA system could be an effective therapeutic strategy for managing impulsive aggressive behavior. However, more research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay between GABA and IED, including the specific mechanisms underlying GABA dysregulation and its relationship to other neurotransmitter systems involved in aggression and impulsivity.

Oxytocin - *** Probably not worth it

Conversely, some studies have found that individuals with IED have lower plasma levels of oxytocin (Ho et al., 2014), which could potentially contribute to impaired emotional regulation and increased aggression.

Vasopressin

Vasopressin is a nonapeptide hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure, fluid balance, and social behavior. It also has various other functions, including modulation of social behavior, stress responses, and aggression. The hypothalamus produces vasopressin and carries it to the posterior pituitary gland for release into circulation, where it acts as a hormone. Additionally, research has identified several vasopressin receptors and transporters that may be involved in the development and maintenance of IED. The neurotransmitter system involving vasopressin operates through two main types of receptors: V1a and V1b. The V1a receptor is primarily located in the central nervous system and is implicated in social bonding and aggression (Cai et al., 2009). The V1b receptor is involved in stress responses (Landgren et al., 2008). 

Studies have shown that individuals with IED have elevated levels of vasopressin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to healthy individuals. For instance, one study found that plasma vasopressin levels were higher in subjects diagnosed with IED compared to healthy controls (Silka & Hurley, 1999). One study found that individuals with IED had higher levels of the vasopressin V1A receptor in the prefrontal cortex compared to healthy individuals. Another study found that individuals with IED had lower levels of the vasopressin V2 receptor in the hypothalamus compared to healthy individuals. These findings suggest that dysregulation of vasopressin receptors and transporters may play a role in the development and maintenance of IED. The vasopressin transporter VTL3 regulates extracellular concentrations of vasopressin, influencing its availability to bind to receptors. Variation in the VTL3 gene has been associated with IED and related disorders in humans. A study by Silka et al. (1999) found that individuals with IED had significantly higher frequencies of certain genetic variants of the VTL3 gene compared to controls, suggesting a possible link between vasopressin transport and the disorder.

Substance P

One such neurotransmitter is substance P (SP), a member of the tachykinin family and composed of 11 amino acids, which is a neuropeptide that plays a crucial role in the regulation of pain, inflammation, and the stress response. SP is released by sensory neurons in response to noxious stimuli and acts on specific receptors. These include the NK1 (neurokinin-1), NK2, and NK3 receptors. The NK1 receptor is the most well-characterized and is primarily located on neurons in the central nervous system, including those involved in pain processing. The NK2 receptor is less common but is also found in the brain, while the NK3 receptor is predominantly found in the peripheral nervous system.

Studies have shown that SP levels are elevated in individuals with IED compared to healthy controls, and that SP receptors and transporters are also altered in IED patients. For example, a study by Coccaro et al. (2009b) found that individuals with IED had reduced levels of SP in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to healthy controls, and that SP receptor density was also reduced in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in IED patients.

Another study by Lee et al. (2012) found that reducing SP levels through tryptophan depletion was followed by increased aggression in IED patients compared with healthy individuals.

Neuroinflammation

Recent research has suggested that IED may be associated with neuroinflammation, a condition characterized by the activation of the immune system in response to injury or infection. Neuroinflammation has been implicated in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and depression (Sarkar & Miller, 2015).

Studies have shown that individuals with IED have elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), compared to healthy controls (Silva et al., 2014). These cytokines are involved in the activation of microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, and have been linked to the development and progression of various neurological and psychiatric disorders (Sarkar & Miller, 2015). Studies have shown that individuals with IED may exhibit elevated levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6, compared to healthy controls or those without the disorder.

Additionally, research has suggested that IED may be associated with changes in brain structure and function, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in the regulation of emotion and behavior (Fanning, 2016). These changes have been linked to alterations in the expression of genes involved in neuroinflammation, such as the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) (Silva et al., 2014).

Peng et al. (2016) found evidence of altered brain activation patterns during anger provocation tasks in individuals with IED compared to control participants. The authors also reported increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of oxidative stress in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with IED, indicating that neuroinflammation may contribute to the pathophysiology of this condition.

  

Genetic Correlations

Family Studies

Family studies are important in understanding the etiology and potential genetic basis of IED. Family studies have shown that there is an elevated morbid risk of IED in first-degree relatives of individuals who meet criteria for IED compared with first-degree relatives of individuals who do not meet criteria for IED (Coccaro, 1999). Familial inheritance of IED was not affected by comorbidity in the IED probands and their relatives. 

Hostility, impulsiveness and irritability were found to be the most significant heritability estimates for IED. This, along with family history data, suggests that IED may be heritable and runs in families. An increased frequency of IED-IR in first-degree relatives of IED-IR probands was found in a family history study using IED-IR criteria (Coccaro, 1999).

Several studies have investigated the familial aggregation of IED and related conditions. One study conducted at an outpatient clinical research center for impulsive aggression examined the family history of IED and co-morbid conditions among first-degree relatives of individuals with and without IED using DSM-IV and Research Criteria (Coccaro et al., 2016). The results indicated a higher prevalence of IED and related conditions in the family members of individuals with IED, suggesting a genetic component to the disorder. Another important aspect is that individuals with IED had higher rates of substance use disorders and other mental health issues among their family members, further supporting a genetic or environmental link. These findings highlight the need for future research into the genetics and early development of IED to better understand its etiology and potential interventions.

  
  
  

Twin Studies

Twin studies have been conducted to investigate the genetic correlates of IED. This finding suggests a potential genetic contribution to the development of IED, as twin studies have shown that monozygotic twins are more concordant for IED than dizygotic twins, further supporting a genetic basis for the disorder. Furthermore, a twin study reported that the heritability of IED is approximately 50%, indicating a strong genetic component to the disorder (15).

  

Candidate Gene Studies

Several studies have identified specific DNA polymorphisms that are associated with IED. For example, a study by Coccaro et al. (2000) increased risk of IED in first-degree relatives of IED probands compared to control probands. This elevation in the morbid risk of IED was not due to comorbidity with borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality, major depressive disorder, or substance use disorder in the IED probands or in the relatives of the IED probands. These findings suggest that IED is familial and phenotypically independent of other conditions.

Another area of research is the role of dopaminergic polymorphic risk alleles in the development of IED. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, motivation, and behavior. Several studies have identified specific dopaminergic polymorphisms that are associated with IED. For example, a study by Modestino et al. (2022) found that certain dopaminergic polymorphisms were associated with IED. The authors suggest that these polymorphisms may contribute to the development of IED by altering the function of dopaminergic receptors in the brain.

Another study identified genetic variants associated with IED, including those in the monoamine oxidase A gene, which plays a role in the breakdown of neurotransmitters like serotonin (13). Additionally, a genome-wide association study found that certain variations in the MAOA gene were more common in individuals with IED, suggesting a possible link between this gene and the disorder (14). Some of these studies have identified variations in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA), and the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) as potential contributors to IED.

  
  

Psychosocial Factors

Early Life Experiences

Recent research has also indicated that IED is related to traumatic events in childhood (Nickerson, 2012). The relationship between IED and age at first trauma exposure suggests that IED is related to childhood exposure to interpersonal traumatic events (Nickerson, 2012). The typically early onset of IED also suggests that traumatic event exposure in childhood may lead to development of IED (Kessler et al., 2006; Coccaro, 2010; Yoshimasu and Kawakami, 2010). Several studies have suggested that childhood adversities, including physical and emotional abuse, neglect, and family dysfunction, may contribute to the development of IED (Burke et al., 1988; McCormick & Cohen, 2004). A study by Burke et al. (1988) found that individuals with IED reported higher rates of childhood physical abuse and neglect compared to control groups. Furthermore, family conflict has also been implicated in the development of IED, with some research indicating that children from families with high levels of conflict are at increased risk for developing IED (McCormick & Cohen, 2004).

  

School-related factors may also play a role in the development of IED. Academic difficulties and bullying have been associated with IED symptoms. For instance, McCormick and Cohen (2004) reported that individuals with IED were more likely to experience academic problems during childhood compared to controls. Additionally, studies suggest that children who are bullied may be at increased risk for developing aggression and other externalizing behaviors, which could potentially contribute to the development of IED later in life (Bradshaw et al., 2009).

  

Stressful Life Events

  

Stressful life events have been identified as a potential risk factor for the development of IED. A study by McLaughlin et al. (2012) found that individuals with IED reported more stressful life events than those without the disorder. These events included interpersonal conflicts, academic or work-related problems, and family issues. The study also found that individuals with IED were more likely to experience negative outcomes, such as depression and anxiety, as a result of these stressful events. For example, repeated exposure to stressors in childhood can lead to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in increased cortisol levels and alterations in brain development, particularly in regions involved in emotion regulation [7]. This neurobiological response to stress may predispose individuals to aggression [8].

  

A study by Phan et al. (2016) found that children who experienced severe life events in childhood, especially those involving neglect or abuse, were more likely to develop IED if they had a family history of the disorder [9]. This suggests involvement of both environmental and genetic factors in the development of IED.

  

Family Environment

Another study found that childhood adversity, particularly parental physical abuse and neglect, was more common in individuals with IED compared to controls (Morris et al., 2001). A more recent study conducted by Shevidi et al. (2023) examined childhood and parental characteristics of adults with DSM-5 IED compared with healthy and psychiatric controls. They found specific patterns associated with IED which include: lack of dual-parent involvement, experiencing physical aggression, and fighting with peers by age ten. The Al-Hamzawi et al. study in Acta Psychiatr Scand explored the prevalence and correlates of Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) in Iraq, specifically focusing on its association with family environment. The researchers found that individuals with IED were more likely to report experiencing childhood maltreatment, including physical abuse, emotional neglect, and witnessing parental conflict. Additionally, they reported higher levels of stress, poorer family functioning, and lower social support compared to those without IED. These findings suggest that a dysfunctional family environment may play a role in the development or exacerbation of IED.

  

Socioeconomic Factors

Recent research has found that higher education may be a protective factor in the case of IED, as it is associated with greater intelligence and problem-solving skills. This can lead to developing coping strategies for anger self-management. Additionally, lower household income has been found to be associated with a higher prevalence of IED. The study found that individuals with lower education levels had a higher prevalence of IED compared to those with higher education levels. Specifically, the prevalence of IED was 1.5% among those with no formal education, 0.9% among those with primary education, and 0.6% among those with secondary or higher education.

  
  

Cognitive Factors

Vulnerability Factors

Vulnerability factors of IED include pre-existing difficulties in emotion regulation, impulse control, and social cognition. Individuals with IED may find it difficult to control their impulses compared to those with better psychological defense mechanisms and stress management skills (Coccaro, 2003, 2011). 

Individuals with IED may also have difficulty with affect dysregulation, which refers to the inability to change or regulate emotional/behavioral responses (Linehan et al., 2007). Life events, such as specific conditioned fear experiences, may also contribute to the development of IED in individuals with intellectual and communication impairments (McCloskey et al., 2010). There is also evidence that IED is primarily dependent on global emotion regulation deficits, rather than anger alone (Aggr. Behav. 41:25 –33, 2015). This supports the claim that a multidisciplinary team would be ideal for managing IED. This team may include a psychiatrist, behavior specialist, speech/language therapist, occupational therapist, and social worker where necessary. Family, teachers, and other social supports the patient has available are also vital members of the multidisciplinary team.

  

Development Pathways

  

Cognitive deficits, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and learning disabilities, have been linked to the development of IED. Children with ADHD may have difficulty regulating their emotions and may be more prone to outbursts. Similarly, children with learning disabilities may struggle with frustration and may be prone to engage in aggressivity.

Poor anger management skills are also a key factor in the development of IED. Children who struggle to regulate their emotions may be more likely to engage in aggressive behavior when they feel frustrated or upset. This can lead to a cycle of anger and aggression that can be difficult to break. Several studies have assessed the development of these problems from pregnancy to adolescence, providing valuable insights into the potential pathways leading to the disorder. For instance, a longitudinal study by Tremblay et al. (2019) found that children who later developed IED showed higher levels of aggression and other problematic behaviors during their early years, indicating that these issues may have roots in early childhood development. 

  

Maintaining Factors

  

Some of the maintaining factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of IED include rumination, hostile attribution biases, and deficits in problem-solving skills.

Rumination is a cognitive process that involves repetitive thinking about a particular event or situation. People with IED may ruminate excessively about past events or situations that triggered their aggressive outbursts, leading to a buildup of negative emotions and increasing the likelihood of future outbursts. For instance, rumination has been found to be a significant predictor of aggressive behavior in individuals with IED. Rumination refers to the repetitive focus on negative emotions, thoughts, and feelings, which can intensify anger and frustration, leading to increased risk of outbursts (Kim et al., 2017).

Hostile attribution biases refer to the tendency to attribute negative intentions to others, even in situations where there may be no evidence of malice. People with IED may have a heightened tendency to interpret ambiguous situations as threatening or hostile, leading to increased feelings of anger and aggression. Hostile attribution biases, or the tendency to interpret ambiguous situations as threatening, have also been linked to IED. This cognitive distortion can provoke defensive reactions, heightening the likelihood of aggressive responses (McLaughlin & Bench, 2004).

Deficits in problem-solving skills can also contribute to the maintenance of IED. People with IED may struggle to find effective ways to manage their emotions and may rely on impulsive or aggressive behaviors as a coping mechanism. This can lead to a cycle of negative emotions and aggressive behavior that is difficult to break.

Furthermore, emotional processing abilities, such as alexithymia and empathy, have emerged as relevant areas of study in understanding the maintenance of IED. Alexithymia, characterized by diﬃculties recognizing and expressing emotions, may impair individuals' ability to identify and regulate their own emotional states, leading to impulsive aggression (Bagby et al., 1994). Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, is often reduced in those with IED, which can result in a lack of consideration for the consequences of their aggressive actions on others (Levenson et al., 2008).
